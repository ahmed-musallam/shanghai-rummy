####Rules of Shanghi Rummy

####Number of Players:
3 to 8

####The Deck:
Each deck includes: 52 cards and 2 jokers.

- **3 to 4 players:** 2 decks
- **5 to 6 players:** 3 decks
- **7 to 8 players:** 4 decks

####Burning and Discarding
> this is customary and by no means neccessary

This is done by annoncing the card to everyone then placing it face-up under the deck. If the burned card happens to be a face card (King, Queen, Jack or Ace) that card is placed back into the deck at a random location. Another card is then drawn and the process continues utill a non face card is drawn. 

####Dealing
**shuffling:** 
Choose a **dealer**. The dealer shuffles the cards and asks the player to their left to cut the deck.

**Burning a card:** *Customary and not neccesary*. Upon cutting the deck, burn a card. This is done by annoncing the card to everyone then placing it face-up under the deck. If the burned card happens to be a face card (King, Queen, Jack or Ace) that card is placed back into the deck at a random location. Another card is then drawn and the process continues utill a non face card is drawn and burned.

**Dealing:** Each player is then dealt 11 cards.

**Discarding** After dealing, a card is discarded (face-up) to start the **discard pile**

####Goal
A game has 7 rounds, each **round** has a **contract**. A contract is a set of rules that dictate what the player will be collecting in order to **lay-down**. The player who lays down all of their cards first, wins the round.

####Contract
For each of the 7 rounds, there is a contract. A contract is a set of rules that dectate what the player will be collecting in order to **lay-down**.

The contracts for the 7 rounds are played in order:

1. 2 sets of 3
2. 1 set of 3 & 1 run of 4
3. 2 runs of 4
4. 3 sets of 3
5. 2 sets of 3 & 1 run of 4
6. 1 set of 3 & 2 runs of 4
7. 3 runs of 4
8. 2 sets of 3 & 2 runs of 4
9. 4 sets of 3

- **Set of 3** 3 **or more** cards of the same **value** regardless of suite.
- **Run of 4** 4 **or more** consecutive cards of the same suite.

**For rounds of 2 or more sets or runs:**

- No 2 sets can have the same value. For example: [3,3,3] and [3,3,3] are, infact, one big set: [3,3,3,3,3,3].
- No two runs can be consicutive. for example: [1,2,3,4] [5,6,7,8] cannot be layed down as two runs while: [1,2,3,4] [4,5,6,7] can be layed down as two runs; the '4' seperates the two runs, in this case.

####Wild cards
- **Joker:** a joker can substitue any card, but only **one** Joker is allowed per set or run.
- **Ace** in a run, the Ace can be played after a '2' or before a king (of the same suite). An Ace before a kink is not considered a '1'; a player **can't** play the run [Q,K,Ace,2] for example.

###Game Play

####Player Turn
Each player's turn starts with a draw of one card. A Player may draw one card from the top of the deck **or** the top card on the discard pile (discarded by previous player). The turn ends with the discard of one card to the discard pile (face up). between a draw and a discard, a player may **lay-down** a collection of cards that meet the current round's contract.

####Laying down
A player may lay-down once they've collected cards that match the correct contract. Once ready to lay-down, place your cards on the table from high to low for everyone to see. A player does not have to lay down all of thier cards at once.

####After Laying down
Once a player lays down, they can add cards to their own sets/runs and other players sets/runs in subsequent turns.


####Buying
> A player may buy only twice, and **before** laying down.

After any player discards and it's not your turn, you may ask to buy the discarded card (even if you've discarded it). The player whose turn is closest from the player who discarded has precedence to buy the card. If all players, between the discarding player and you, do not want to buy, you are granted a buy. Once granted a buy, you can pick the discarded card plus 2 other cards from the top of the deck. The game, then, proceeds as normal.

####Winning
A player can win the game by laying-down all of their cards or laying down the contract then adding cards to already layed down sets/runs. The last card **cannot** be discarded to win the game.

####Scoring
After a player wins the round. Each player counts the points for all the cards in their hands following the card-to-point list:

- Joker: 50
- Ace: 20
- 2-7: 5
- 8-K: 10

points are recorder for each round. The player with the least score at the end of all 7 rounds wins!
